  I’m thrilled to have participated in the 2024 IEEE 20th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE 2024), held in Bari, a beautiful city in Italy. As one of the flagship conferences under IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS), this year’s event focused on Automation 5.0, bringing together cutting-edge research and innovations. The keynote talks were particularly inspiring, providing deep insights into the future of automation.

  I had the honor of co-chairing the regular sessions and presenting our latest research titled "Frontal Target Approaching and Height Control of Micro Air Vehicles using Multi-perspective Optical Flow Observables." Our work addresses the challenges faced by micro air vehicles in accurately estimating forward distance and height for autonomous navigation in GPS-denied environments. Inspired by the navigational strategies of tiny flying insects like honeybees, we proposed a novel approach using optical flow observables from multiple perspectives to estimate both depth and height estimation during flight. The results from both simulations and flight tests have validated our method, marking a significant step forward in this field.
