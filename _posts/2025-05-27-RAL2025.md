<p>
We are delighted to share that our paper "ForaNav: Insect-Inspired Online Target-Oriented Navigation for MAVs in Tree Plantations" has been accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)! 
We take inspiration from insect foraging behavior to address a critical challenge in precision agriculture: enabling autonomous Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) to navigate dense tree plantations—without GPS or prior maps.
</p>
<p>
Introducing ForaNav: an insect-inspired visual navigation system designed for lightweight MAVs.
</p>
<p>
Key features include:
- Robust Tree Detection
  A novel HOG-based algorithm enhanced with Hue-Saturation histograms and feature variance analysis for reliable tree identification.

- Adaptive Path Planning
  Real-time path adjustments based on visual input—no pre-mapped routes required.

- Recovery Strategy
  A fallback mechanism that helps the MAV re-acquire lost targets during navigation.

- Optimized Onboard Performance
  Lower CPU usage, reduced heat, and higher FPS compared to standard lightweight deep learning models—designed for real-world deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

- Tested in the flight
Through real-world flight experiments, ForaNav enables MAVs to:
✅ Dynamically detect and approach all trees
✅ Operate effectively with zero prior knowledge of tree locations
✅ Navigate robustly and in real time within dense plantation environments
