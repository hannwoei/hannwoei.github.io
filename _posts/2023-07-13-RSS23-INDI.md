Together with Ye Zhou, we are delighted to share our conference paper on optical flow control for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs)! This paper introduces an efficient data-driven Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) control scheme that addresses the challenge of nonlinear optical flow observables. Our method directly estimates the inverse of the time-varying control effectiveness in real-time, eliminating the need for the constant assumption and avoiding high computation in traditional INDI. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of this approach through numerical simulations and real-world flight tests, showcasing successful tracking and landings on both static and dynamic surfaces. 
Excited to present how this work can revolutionize optical flow control in MAVs at hashtag#RSS2023 next week on the 13th of July 2023, in the session on Control & Dynamics, from 13:30 to 14:30, and discuss our work at the poster session, from 16:00 to 17:00.
