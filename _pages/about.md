Hello! I am Hann Woei. My research focuses on bio-inspired vision and control, machine learning, advanced flight control, Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) design, and swarm. It involves creating autonomous MAVs by integrating theory and practice, which are extremely challenging, yielding numerous publications as the first/corresponding author, including IEEE Transactions on Robotics (<b>T-RO</b>), Aerospace Science and Technology (<b>AESCTE</b>), Robotics and Autonomous Systems (<b>RAS</b>), Journal of Aerospace Information Systems published by American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (<b>AIAA</b>), Robotics: Science and Systems (<b>RSS</b>), IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (<b>IROS</b>), and other prestigious journals. I have successfully secured several highly competitive national grants and been awarded various prizes in both national and international conferences/competitions, including two best paper awards and four technology challenge awards.
